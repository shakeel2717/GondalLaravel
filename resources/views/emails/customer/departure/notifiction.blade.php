Hello {{ $booking->passengers[0]->firstname }} {{ $booking->passengers[0]->lastname }},

To ensure a smooth travel experience, here are a few things you should keep in mind to be ready to fly: 

1.Check-in: Make sure you have completed the check-in process either online or at the airport, depending on the airline's requirements. This includes obtaining your boarding pass.
2.Luggage: Verify the baggage allowance for your flight and pack accordingly. Check if you need to carry any essential items in your carry-on luggage and ensure they meet the airline's restrictions. 
3.Pack your essentials: Make sure you have all the necessary travel documents, such as your passport, boarding pass, and any required visas. Pack your bags with the items you'll need during your trip, including clothes, toiletries, medications, and any other personal belongings.
4.Arrive at the airport early: It's advisable to arrive at the airport at least two hours before domestic flights and three hours before international flights. This will give you enough time to check in
